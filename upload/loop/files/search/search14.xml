Here, we are using a for loop inside another for loop.:@0.052850:0.525365:0.594098:0.525365:0.594098:0.489569:0.052850:0.489569:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000
We can use the nested loop to iterate through each:@0.052850:0.603143:0.583167:0.603143:0.583167:0.567347:0.052850:0.567347:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000:0.000000
